I am currently a final-year computer science Ph.D. student at Purdue University. My advisor is [Voicu Popescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/popescu/).

My research interest is the use of augmented and virtual reality for interactive guidance and task completion. First, I am interested in the applications of AR/VR for medical and educational applications, such as surgical telementoring. Second, I am interested in providing automated AR guidance to users completing acquisition-based tasks, such as 3D scanning of indoor environments to a desired level of coverage.
