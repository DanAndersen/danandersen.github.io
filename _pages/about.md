I am a research scientist in the field of augmented and virtual reality. I received my Ph.D. in spring 2020 from Purdue University, and was a member of the [CGVLab](http://wiki.cs.purdue.edu/cgvlab/). My advisor was [Dr Voicu Popescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/popescu/).

My [dissertation](https://hammer.figshare.com/articles/Effective_User_Guidance_through_Augmented_Reality_Interfaces_Advances_and_Applications/12184701) focused on the use of augmented and virtual reality for interactive guidance and task completion. First, I investigated the applications of AR/VR for medical and educational applications, such as surgical telementoring. Second, I investigated providing automated AR guidance to users completing acquisition-based tasks, such as 3D scanning of indoor environments to a desired level of coverage.
