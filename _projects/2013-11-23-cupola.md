In 2013, I developed a Chrome packaged app to help connect the Oculus Rift DK1 with browser-based VR environments.

At the time, this was done to help bridge a gap in Web VR technologies:

- [vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js) had been used as an NPAPI plugin for Chrome and Firefox, but Chrome [discontinued support for NPAPI apps in 2013](https://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html).

- [oculus-bridge](https://github.com/Instrument/oculus-bridge) was a tool that used WebSockets to stream orientation data, but at the cost of poor latency.

In contrast, Cupola VR Viewer used Chromeâ€™s USB API to get the raw sensor data from the Rift, and I reimplemented parts of the Oculus SDK in Javascript to translate the sensor data into the orientation. I found that this approach provides lower latency than WebSockets, and is unencumbered by the loss of NPAPI plugins in Chrome.

**Note: This effort has been completely replaced by modern [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) technologies, and is here provided only for historical reference.**
