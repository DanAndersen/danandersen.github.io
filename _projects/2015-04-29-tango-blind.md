Starting in the spring of 2015, as part of my work at Purdue’s [Envision Center](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision/), I began creating a navigation system for people with visual disabilities, using the Google Project Tango tablet depth camera. In short, it builds a 3D representation of the user’s surroundings in real time and converts it to 3D audio for navigational cues.

Here is a video demonstrating the current system (as of May 2015). Please note that the audio is very quiet due to hasty recording.
