From 2014 through 2019, I was part of an interdisciplinary team at Purdue University to use augmented reality to enhance surgical telementoring. The STAR project was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense with the goal of increasing the sense of co-presence between a local generalist surgeon and a remote expert mentor. With a series of prototype systems -- first in the form of a tablet suspended above the patient's body, and later in the form of an AR headset like the Microsoft HoloLens -- we demonstrated through a set of user studies and clinical trials that AR can help to improve communication between mentor and mentee in a surgical context.
