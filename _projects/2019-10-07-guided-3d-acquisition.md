From 2018 to 2019, my research focus during my PhD studies at Purdue University were in using AR HMDs to help guide users to acquire real-world scenes for photogrammetric reconstruction. This work was presented at ISMAR 2019. For more information, please see the [publication page on this site](/publication/2019-08-12-ismar).
