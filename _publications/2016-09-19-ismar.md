excerpt: "Hand-held transparent displays are important infrastructure for augmented reality applications. Truly transparent displays are not yet feasible in hand-held form, and a promising alternative is to simulate transparency by displaying the image the user would see if the display were not there. Previous simulated transparent displays have important limitations, such as being tethered to auxiliary workstations, requiring the user to wear obtrusive head-tracking devices, or lacking the depth acquisition support that is needed for an accurate transparency effect for close-range scenes.

We describe a general simulated transparent display and three prototype implementations (P1, P2, and P3), which take advantage of emerging mobile devices and accessories. P1 uses an off-the-shelf smartphone with built-in head-tracking support; P1 is compact and suitable for outdoor scenes, providing an accurate transparency effect for scene distances greater than 6m. P2 uses a tablet with a built-in depth camera; P2 is compact and suitable for short-distance indoor scenes, but the user has to hold the display in a fixed position. P3 uses a conventional tablet enhanced with on-board depth acquisition and head tracking accessories; P3 compensates for user head motion and provides accurate transparency even for close-range scenes. The prototypes are hand-held and self-contained, without the need of auxiliary workstations for computation."
